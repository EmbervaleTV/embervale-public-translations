thought this might be useful to pin somewhere? or is the github link a bad idea

How to submit events:

To submit an event, open a bug ticket in report-a-bug https://discord.com/channels/840176928984268811/840499984209149992/1255560170080047117 
This will give you a persistent ticket that you can go back and edit, add to, and that staff can easily contact you on.

From there, you should say that you're submitting an event, and then post the event in question. It's enough to share an idea for an event, but it helps to write out what the scenario is, what the options will be, and what text follows those options. Even if you don't think you're a very good writer, giving an example of how you want it to look will help make sure the final event matches how you imagined it. Each outcome should mention what effects you want it to have â€“ gained/lost morale, chests, effects and how long they last, tools, and so on. You can suggest skill rolls, what difficulty you want those skill rolls to be, and even suggest multiple outcomes for the same option.

A list of all effects and tools in the game can be found here: https://github.com/EmbervaleTV/embervale-public-translations/blob/main/base-en/adventureData.txt

Events that use the existing functionality of the game can be added much faster than events that would need to add new features, effects, and filters.

You'll know your ticket was seen when it gets labeled adventure-ideas. Once it's marked solved, its ready to be added to the game!
