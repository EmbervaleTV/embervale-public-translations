### 📝 What to Include in Your Submission  
1. **State that you're submitting an event.**  
2. **Describe your event idea.** You can submit just an idea, but providing more details helps:  
   - What is the **scenario**?  
   - What **options** do players have?  
   - What **text** follows each option?  
3. **Specify outcomes.** Each option should mention its effects, such as:  
   - Gained/lost **morale**, **chests**, **effects**, or **tools**  
   - How long effects last  
   - Suggested **skill rolls** and difficulty levels  
   - Multiple possible outcomes for the same choice  

Even if you're not confident in writing, a rough draft of how you imagine it will help ensure the final event fits your vision.
