# Contribution Guide

We appreciate your help in shaping our events! There are two ways to contribute:


### 💡  Ideas  
If you just want to suggest ideas, use **[SimpleGuide.md](SimpleGuide.md)**.  
Keep it concise—focus on the core concept rather than full implementation details.

### 🔧 Fully Built Event(s)
If you want to build a complete, ready-to-implement event, use **[DetailedGuide.md](DetailedGuide.md)**.  
This should include all necessary details, making it easy to integrate into the project.

Thanks for contributing! 🚀

## General Guidelines:

### ✅ Event Guidelines  
- **Text must be original** – It cannot be copied or just rewritten from any source.  
- **Must fit the game theme** – Events should align with the world, lore, and atmosphere of the game.  
- **References to other game series** – Subtle references can be fun, but avoid direct mentions. Instead, transcribe the essence of the reference—most players will recognize it.  
- **No references to real players or streamers** – Avoid any mentions that could directly reference individuals.
- **Avoid content that could upset a large number of players** – Events should be engaging and fun, not divisive and cause discussions. For example, avoid topics like religion, game balancing, explicit or adult-themed content, or real-world events.

### ⚖️ Balancing Events and Rewards  

We understand that you want your event to include loot. However, to maintain game balance, not every event can hand out a Mythical Chest.  

If an event has four options, and one simply gives a Mythical Chest with no downside, it risks becoming predictable and uninteresting.  

#### How to Balance Rewards  
To make events engaging and fair, consider:  
- **Probability-Based Rewards** – The best outcomes should have a lower chance of occurring.  
- **Dice Rolls & Challenges** – Players could roll dice or meet certain conditions to unlock rewards.  
- **Risk vs. Reward** – Introduce trade-offs like fainting players, triggering a battle, or requiring a sacrifice.  
- **Decision-Making** – Make players think: *Is this worth the risk?*  

Balancing events ensures that each choice matters and keeps the game fun and exciting for everyone!
